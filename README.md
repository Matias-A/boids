I ran across a life simulation algorithm called [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), and wanted to implement it using React.

This project does just that: it lets you control the parameters and see the visualization in real time.

To run the program, clone the repository and run the following:
```
npm install
npm start
```
